Getting Started
---------------

The purpose of this guide is to provide a sampling of hands-on exercises to better understand deployment of F5 SSL Orchestrator.

WHAT IS THE F5 SSL ORCHESTRATOR?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    F5 SSL Orchestrator (SSLO) provides an all-in-one appliance solution
    designed specifically to optimize the SSL infrastructure, provide
    security devices with visibility of SSL/TLS encrypted traffic, and
    maximize efficient use of that existing security investment. This
    solution supports policy-based management and steering of traffic
    flows to existing security devices, designed to easily integrate
    into existing architectures, and centralizes the SSL decrypt/encrypt
    function by delivering the latest SSL encryption technologies across
    the entire security infrastructure.

Multi-layered security
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    In order to solve specific security challenges, security
    administrators are accustomed to manually chaining together multiple
    point products, creating a bare-bones “security stack” consisting of
    multiple services. A typical stack may include components like Data
    Leak Prevention (DLP) scanners, Web Application Firewalls (WAF),
    Intrusion Prevention and Detection Systems (IPS and IDS), Malware
    Analysis tools, and more. In this model, all user sessions are
    provided the same level of security, as this “daisy chain” of
    services is hard-wired.

Dynamic service chaining
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Dynamic service chaining effectively breaks the daisy chain paradigm
    by processing specific connections based on context provided by the
    Security Policy, that then allows specific types of traffic to flow
    through arbitrary chains of services. These service chains can
    include five types of services: layer 2 inline services, layer 3
    inline services, receive-only services, ICAP services, and HTTP web
    proxy services.


Topologies
^^^^^^^^^^

    Different environments call for different network implementations.
    While some can easily support SSL visibility at layer 3 (routed),
    others may require these devices to be inserted at layer 2. SSL
    Orchestrator can support all of these networking requirements with
    the following topology options:

-  Outbound transparent proxy

-  Outbound explicit proxy

-  Outbound layer 2

Security Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Inbound reverse proxy

-  Existing application

-  Inbound layer 2

    The SSLO Security Policy provides a rich set of context-aware
    methods to dynamically determine how best to optimize traffic flow
    through the security stack. Context can minimally come from the
    following:

-  Source and destination address/subnet

-  URL filtering and IP intelligence - Subscriptions

-  Host and domain name

-  Destination port

-  IP geolocation

-  Protocol

    **WHAT’S NEW IN SSLO 4.0 AND 5.0?**

    SSLO 4.0 provides significant architectural improvements over
    previous versions. Here are just a few of those updates:

-  SSLO 4.0 replaces the complex iRules-based traffic classification and
   service chaining functions of previous versions with an Access
   per-request policy engine, providing much greater flexibility in
   traffic management options.

-  SSLO 4.0 optimizes traffic flow through security services by
   replacing the complex “proxy hops” with a new “tee connector” –
   essentially a mid-proxy tap – that allows decrypted traffic to flow
   through security devices out-of-band from the main client-server
   proxy traffic. This is implemented as new “Service” and “Connector”
   profiles.

-  SSLO 4.0 introduces new “split session” client and server SSL
   profiles, that are now responsible for carrying SNI signaling
   information across the inspection zone.

-  SSLO 4.0 further optimizes traffic flow by reducing the amount of
   iRule data plane management, also making it easier to add
   customization iRules.

-  SSLO 4.0 introduces three new network topologies. Along with the
   existing outbound transparent and explicit proxy flows, 4.0 now also
   supports inbound layer 3 (reverse proxy) inspection, and layer 2
   transparent inbound and outbound topologies.

    SSLO 4.0 also includes the following new functionality features:

-  Explicit and transparent web proxy devices as an inline security
   service.

-  Front-end explicit proxy authentication via APM integration (relies
   on existing SWG-Explicit access policy).

-  FTPS (passive), SMTPS, POP3S, and IMAPS protocols inspection.

-  ICAP advanced filtering via LTM CPM policy (relies on an existing CPM
   policy).

-  URL filtering as a function of the Access per-request service
   chaining policy.

-  Authentication headers - ability to define additional HTTP headers to
   pass to inline security services.

-  vCMP support - ability to select existing VLANs for inbound and
   outbound to/from inline services.

    SSLO 5.0 includes the following updates:

-  Guided Configuration user experience, a complete refresh of the SSLO
   UI based on the Access Guided Configuration engine.

-  Discreet “topology” definitions and the ability to define how SSLO
   listens for and processes traffic flows.

-  Re-entrant, wizard-driven workflows. Based on the selected topology,
   SSLO 5.0 presents an intuitive workflow UI that walks the user
   through a simplified object creation process.

WHAT’S NEW IN SSLO 5.1?
=======================

    SSL Orchestrator 5.1 was released on December 17th, 2018, a few days
    after the release of BIG-IP 14.1 with SSLO

1. SSLO 5.1 contains significant updates to the product and is therefore
   recommended (over 5.0) for customer environments.

    Additional information about SSLO 5.1, including updates and fixes,
    can be found in the official release notes:
    *https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/ssl-orchestrator/releasenotes/product/relnote-ssl-orchestrator-14-1-*
    *0-iapp-5-1.html*

    SSL Orchestrator 5.1 is available on the F5 downloads site,
    *https://downloads.f5.com*, under the SSL Orchestrator section, as
    **f5-iappslx-ssl-orchestrator-14.1.0-5.1.254.rpm**.

    This lab guide and corresponding Ravello lab environment are
    prepared for SSLO 5.1. If installing a fresh BIG-IP 14.1 instance,
    it is recommended to immediately download the 5.1 package and
    install over the built-in 5.0 version. To do this, in the SSLO UI,
    click on **SSL Orchestrator** -> **Configuration** -> **Upgrade SSL
    Orchestrator**, choose the downloaded SSLO 5.1 package and then
    upload and install.
