LAB 1 – CREATE A TRANSPARENT FORWARD PROXY SSLO
===============================================

The majority of enterprise forward proxy configurations will involve
a single F5 platform performing the SSL visibility task. The SSL
Orchestrator has been designed with that principle in mind and
performs robust security service chaining of security devices
attached to a single appliance. SSL Orchestrator 5.0 now makes
configuration of a single-box deployment simple and intuitive.
Please follow the steps below to create a transparent forward proxy
SSL Orchestrator configuration.

Step 1: Review the lab environment and map out the services and endpoints
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Review the “SSL Orchestrator Lab Environment” section. This
lab will attach one of each type of security service (HTTP, ICAP,
L2, L3, TAP) to SSLO for an outbound forward proxy traffic flow.
Afterwards, an internal client will be able to access remote
(Internet) resources through SSLO, providing decrypted, inspectable
traffic to the security services.

-  The client is attached to a *10.20.0.0/24* network and is assigned
   the IP *10.20.0.60*. This network is attached to the BIG-IP 1.1
   interface.

-  The **L2 device** is an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server configured to bridge
   its eth1 and eth2 interfaces. Its inbound VLAN (traffic to it) is
   attached to the BIG-IP *1.6* interface. Its outbound interface
   (traffic coming from it) is attached to the BIG-IP *1.7* interface.

-  The **L3 device** is an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server configured to route
   between its eth1.10 and eth1.20 (tagged) interfaces. Its inbound VLAN
   (traffic to it) is attached to the BIG-IP *1.3 (VLAN tag 30)*
   interface and has an IP of *198.19.64.64/25*. Its outbound interface
   (traffic coming from it) is attached to the BIG-IP *1.3 (VLAN tag
   60)* interface and has an IP of *198.19.64.130/25*. Its default
   gateway is *198.19.64.245*, which will be a VLAN self-IP on the
   BIG-IP.

-  The **TAP** device is an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server configured with a
   single eth1 interface. That interface is attached to the BIG-IP *1.4*
   interface.

-  The **DLP/ICAP** device is an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server configured with
   a single eth1 interface. That interface is attached to the BIG-IP
   *1.5* interface and has an IP of *10.70.0.10 and listening on port
   1344*. The box is running c-icap and Squid/Clamav.

-  The **Explicit Proxy device** is an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server
   configured with Squid. Its interfaces are eth1.30 and eth1.40
   (tagged). Its inbound VLAN (traffic to it) is attached to the BIG-IP
   *1.3 (VLAN tag 110)* interface and has an IP of *198.19.96.66/25*.
   Its outbound interface (traffic coming from it) is attached to the
   BIG-IP

   *1.3 (VLAN tag 120)* interface and has an IP of *198.19.96.136/25*.
   Its default gateway is *198.19.96.245*, which will be a VLAN self-IP
   on the BIG-IP.

-  The outbound network is attached to the BIG-IP *1.2* interface, in
   the *10.30.0.0/24* subnet, and has a gateway of *10.30.0.1*.

-  In the lab, client inbound, Internet outbound, and DLP VLANs and
   self-IPs are already created.

Step 2: Fulfill the SSL Orchestrator prerequisites
--------------------------------------------------

There are a number of objects that SSL Orchestrator does not create
and expects to exist before deploying the iApp. You must create the
following objects before starting the iApp:

-  **Import the CA certificate and private key** – in order to terminate
   and re-encrypt outbound SSL traffic, SSL Forward Proxy must re-issue,
   or rather “forge” a new server certificate to the client. In order to
   perform this re-issuance process, the BIG-IP must possess a
   certificate authority (CA) certificate and associated private key.
   *This lab environment already has a subordinate CA certificate and
   private key installed*.

-  **Create the client inbound VLAN and self-IP** – create the VLAN and
   self-IP that connects the client to the BIG-IP. In this lab that’s
   the *10.20.0.0/24* subnet and interface *1.1* on the BIG-IP. This lab
   environment already has this VLAN and self-IP created.

-  **Create the Internet outbound VLAN and self-IP** – create the VLAN
   and self-IP that connects the BIG-IP to the outbound Internet router.
   In this lab that’s the *10.30.0.0/24* subnet and interface *1.2* on
   the BIG-IP. *This lab environment already has this VLAN and self-IP
   created*.

-  **Create the DLP VLAN and self-IP** – if it is desired to isolate the
   DLP/ICAP device, create the VLAN and self- IP that connects the DLP
   device to the BIG-IP. In this lab that’s the *10.70.0.0/24* subnet
   and interface *1.5* on the BIG-IP. The DLP security device is
   listening on *10.70.0.10* and ICAP is listening on port *1344*. *This
   lab environment already has this VLAN and self-IP created*.

-  **Create the default internet route for outbound traffic** – the iApp
   provides an option to leverage a defined gateway pool or use the
   system default route. If a gateway pool is not used, they system
   route table will need to have a default route used to reach Internet
   destination. *We’ll use a gateway pool defined within SSLO to create
   this Route*.

Step 3: Create the SSL Orchestrator deployment through Guided Configuration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SSL Orchestrator Guided Configuration presents a completely new
and streamlined user experience. This workflow-based architecture
provides intuitive, re-entrant configuration steps tailored to the
selected topology.

Topology System Settings SSL Configuration Service Service Chain
Security Policy Interception Rule Summary

The following steps will walk through the Guided Configuration (GC)
to build a simple transparent forward proxy.

-  **SSL Orchestrator** - click on **SSL Orchestrator** panel then click
   **Configuration**

   .. image:: /_static/image14.png
      :height: 400px

-  **Initialization** – if this is the first time accessing SSLO in a
   new BIG-IP build, upon first access, GC will automatically load and
   deploy the built-in SSLO package.

   .. image:: /_static/image16.jpeg
      :height: 200px

-  **Configuration review and prerequisites** – take a moment to review
   the topology options and workflow configuration steps involved.
   Optionally satisfy any of the DNS, NTP and Route prerequisites from
   this page. Keep in mind, however, that aside from NTP, the SSLO GC
   will provide an opportunity to define DNS and route settings later in
   the workflow. No other configurations are required on this page, so
   click Next.

   .. Note::
      DNS and NTP settings have already been defined in this lab.

   .. image:: /_static/image17.png
      :height: 400px

   .. image:: /_static/image18.png
      :height: 80px

-  **Topology Properties** – SSLO now creates *discreet* configurations
   based on the selected topology. For example, in previous versions of
   SSLO, a transparent and explicit forward proxy might be defined
   together. In SSLO 5.0, these are configured separately. An explicit
   forward proxy topology will ultimately create an explicit proxy
   listener and its relying transparent proxy lister, but the
   transparent listener will be bound only to the explicit proxy tunnel.
   If a subsequent transparent forward proxy topology is configured, it
   will not overlap the existing explicit proxy objects. The Topology
   Properties page provides the following options,

   The Protocol option presents four protocol types:

-  **TCP** – this option creates a single TCP wildcard interception rule
   for the L3 Inbound, L3 Outbound L3, and L3 Explicit Proxy topologies.

-  **UDP** – this option creates a single UDP wildcard interception rule
   for L3 Inbound and L3 Outbound topologies.

-  **Other** – this option creates a single any protocol wildcard
   interception rule for L3 Inbound and L3 Outbound topologies,
   typically used for non-TCP/UDP traffic flows.

-  **Any** – this option creates the TCP, UDP and non-TCP/UDP
   interception rules for outbound traffic flows.

   The SSL Orchestrator Topologies option page presents six topologies:

   -  **L3 Explicit Proxy** – this is the traditional explicit forward proxy.

   -  **L3 Outbound** – this is the traditional transparent forward proxy.

   -  **L3 Inbound** – this is a reverse proxy “gateway” configuration. In
      its simplest form, this topology builds an SSLO environment designed
      to sit ***in front of*** another ADC or routed path. Advanced options
      allow it to define a pool for more directed traffic flow, but alone
      does not provide the same flexibility afforded a typical LTM reverse
      proxy virtual server. It also must perform re-encryption on egress.
      The primary use case for this topology is as a gateway SSL visibility
      solution, potentially sitting at a boundary edge in front of multiple
      internal ADC environments.

   -  **L2 Inbound** – the layer 2 topology options insert SSLO as a
      bump-in-the-wire in an existing routed path, where SSLO presents no
      IP addresses on its outer edges. The L2 Inbound topology provides a
      transparent path for inbound traffic flows.

   -  **L2 Outbound** – the layer 2 topology options insert SSLO as a
      bump-in-the-wire in an existing routed path, where SSLO presents no
      IP addresses on its outer edges. The L2 Outbound topology provides a
      transparent path for outbound traffic flows.

   .. Note::
      It is important to distinguish	SSLO’s layer 2 topology from those of
      other traditional layer 2 SSL visibility vendors.  “True” layer 2
      solutions like Blue Coat’s SSL visibility appliance (SSLVA) limit the
      types of devices that can be inserted into the inspection zone to
      layer 2 and below, and devices must be directly connected to the
      appliance.  SSLO’s layer 2 topology only exists at the outer edges.
      Inside the inspection zone, full-proxy routing is still happening,
      so layer 3 and HTTP services can still function normally.

   -  **Existing Application** – this topology is designed to work with
      existing LTM applications. Whereas the L3 Inbound topology provides
      an inbound gateway function for SSLO, Existing Application works with
      LTM virtual servers that already perform their own SSL handling and
      client-server traffic management. The Existing Application workflow
      proceeds directly to service creation and security policy definition,
      then exits with an SSLO-type access policy and per-request policy
      that can easily be consumed by an LTM virtual server.

      :height: 60px

-  **SSL Configurations** – this page defines the specific SSL settings
   for the selected topology, in this case a forward proxy, and controls
   both client-side and server-side SSL options. If existing SSL
   settings are available (from a previous workflow), it can be selected
   and re-used. Otherwise the SSL Configurations page creates new SSL
   settings for this workflow. For this lab, create a new SSL profile,

   -  Click on Show Advance Settings

      .. image:: /_static/image23.png
         :height: 200px

   -  Client-side SSL

      -  **Cipher Type** – cipher type can be a Cipher Group or Cipher
         String. If the former, select a previously-defined cipher group
         (from Local Traffic – Ciphers – Groups). If the latter, enter a
         cipher string that appropriately represents the client-side TLS
         requirement. For most environments, DEFAULT is optimal. For this
         lab, lease Cipher String selected.

      -  **Certificate Key Chain** – the certificate key chain represents
         the certificate and private key used as the “template” for forged
         server certificates. While re-issuing server certificates
         on-the-fly is generally easy, private key creation tends to be a
         CPU-intensive operation. For that reason, the underlying SSL
         Forward Proxy engine forges server certificates from a single
         defined private key. This setting gives customers the opportunity
         to apply their own template private key, and optionally store that
         key in a FIPS-certified HSM for additional protection. The
         built-in “default” certificate and private key uses 2K RSA and is
         generated from scratch when the BIG-IP system is installed. The
         pre-defined default.crt and default.key can be left as is. Click
         Done.

      -  **CA Certificate Key Chain** – an SSL forward proxy must re-sign,
         or “forge” remote server certificate to local clients using a
         local certificate authority (CA) certificate, and local clients
         must trust this local CA. This setting defines the local CA
         certificate and private key used to perform the forging operation.
         Click the pencil icon to Edit, then select subca.f5demolabs.com
         for both Certificate and Key, and click Done.

      .. Note::
         SSL Settings minimally require RSA-based template and CA certificates
         but can also support Elliptic Curve (ECDSA) certificates.  In this
         case, SSLO would forge and EC certificate to the client if the TLS
         handshake negotiated an ECDHE_ECDSA cipher.  To enable EC forging
         support, add both an EC template certificate and key, and ECCA
         certificates and key.

      .. image:: /_static/image24.png
         :height: 300px

      -  **[Advanced] Bypass on Handshake Alert** – this setting allows the
         underlying SSL Forward Proxy process to bypass SSL decryption if an
         SSL handshake error is detected on the server side. It is recommended
         to leave this disabled.

      -  **[Advanced] Bypass on Client Certificate Failure** – this setting
         allows the underlying SSL Forward Proxy process to bypass SSL
         decryption if it detects a Certificate request message from the
         server, as in when a server requires mutual certificate
         authentication. It is recommended to leave this disabled.

      .. image:: /_static/image25.png
         :height: 60px

      .. Note::
         The above two Bypass option can create a security vulnerability.
         If a colluding client and server can force and SSL handshake error,
         or force client certificate authentication, they can effectively
         bypass SSL inspection.  It is recommended that these settings be
         left disabled.

   -  Server-side SSL

      -  **Cipher Type** – cipher type can be a Cipher Group or Cipher
         String. If the former, select a previously-defined cipher group
         (from Local Traffic – Ciphers – Groups). If the latter, enter a
         cipher string that appropriately represents the server-side TLS
         requirement. For most environments, DEFAULT is optimal.

      -  **Trusted Certificate Authority** – browser vendors routinely
         update the CA certificate stores in their products to keep up with
         industry security trends, and to account for new and revoked CAs.
         In the SSL forward proxy use case, however, the SSL visibility
         product now performs all server-side certificate validation, in
         lieu of the client browser, and should therefore do its best to
         maintain the *same* industry security trends. BIG-IP ships with a
         CA certificate bundle that maintains a list of CA certificates
         common to the browser vendors. However, a more comprehensive
         bundle can be obtained from the F5 Downloads site. For this lab,
         select the built-in ca-bundle.crt.

      -  **[Advanced] Expire Certificate Response** – SSLO performs
         validation on remote server certificates and can control what
         happens if it receives an expired server certificate. The options
         are **drop**, which simply drops the traffic, and **ignore**,
         which mirrors an expired forged certificate to the client. The
         default and recommended behavior for forward proxy is to drop
         traffic on an expired certificate.

      -  **[Advanced] Untrusted Certificate Authority** – SSLO performs
         validation on remote server certificates and can control what
         happens if it receives an untrusted server certificate, based on
         the Trusted Certificate Authority bundle. The options are
         **drop**, which simply drops the traffic, and **ignore**, which
         allows the traffic and forges a good certificate to the client.
         The default and recommended behavior for forward proxy is to drop
         traffic on an untrusted certificate.

      -  **[Advanced] OCSP** – this setting selects an existing or can
         create a new OCSP profile for server-side Online Certificate
         Status Protocol (OCSP) and OCSP stapling. With this enabled, if a
         client issues a Status\_Request message in its ClientHello message
         (an indication that it supports OCSP stapling), SSLO will issue a
         corresponding Status\_Request message in its server-side TLS
         handshake. SSLO will then forge the returned OCSP stapling
         response back to the client. If the server does not respond with a
         staple but contains an Authority Info Access (AIA) field that
         points to an OCSP responder URL, SSLO will perform a separate OCSP
         request. The returned status is then mirrored in the stapled
         client-side TLS handshake. Leave it at ---SELECT----

      -  **[Advanced] CRL** – this setting selects an existing or can
         create a new CRL profile for server- side Certificate Revocation
         List (CRL) validation. With this enabled, SSLO attempts to match
         server certificates to locally-cached CRLs. Leave it at "---SELECT----"

   -  Click Save & Next.

         :height: 60px


-  **Services List** – the Services List page is used to define security
   services that attach to SSLO. The 5.0 SSLO Guided Configuration now
   includes a services catalog that contains common product
   integrations. Beneath each of these catalog options is one of the
   five basic service types. The service catalog also provides “generic”
   security services. Depending on screen resolution, it may be
   necessary to scroll down to see additional services.

      :height: 160px

   .. image:: /_static/image28.png
      :height: 400px

   This lab will create one of each type of security service. Click Add Service
   button, then either select a service from the catalog and click Add, or simply
   double-click the service to go to its configuration page.

-  **Inline layer 2 service** – select the FireEye Inline Layer 2
   service from the catalog and click Add, or simply double-click the
   FireEye Inline Layer 2 service, or any other Inline Layer 2 service
   in the catalog.

   .. image:: /_static/image29.png
      :height: 300px

-  **Name** – provide a unique name to this service (example “FireEye”).

-  **Network Configuration** – paths define the network interfaces that
   take inspectable traffic to the inline service and receive traffic
   from the service. Click Add.

   -  **Ratio** – inline security services are natively load balanced,
      so this setting defines a ratio, if any for the load balanced pool
      members. Enter 1.

   -  **From BIGIP VLAN** – this is the interface taking traffic to the
      inline service. Select the Create New option, enter a unique name
      (ex. FireEye\_in), select the F5 interface connecting to the
      inbound side of the service, and add a VLAN tag value if required.
      For this lab, select interface 1.6.

   -  **To BIGIP VLAN** – this is the interface receiving traffic from
      the inline service. Select the Create New option, enter a unique
      name (ex. FireEye\_out), select the F5 interface connecting to the
      outbound side of the service, and add a VLAN tag value if
      required. For this lab, select interface 1.7.

      .. image:: /_static/image30.png
         :height: 400px

-  Click Done.

-  **Service Action Down** – SSLO also natively monitors the load
   balanced pool of security devices, and if all pool members fail, can
   actively bypass this service (**Ignore**), or stop all traffic
   (**Reset**, **Drop**). For this lab, leave it set to Ignore.

-  **Enable Port Remap** – this setting allows SSLO to remap the port of
   HTTPS traffic flowing across this service. This is advantageous when
   a security service defines port 443 traffic as encrypted HTTPS and
   natively ignores it. By remapping HTTPS traffic to, say, port 8080,
   the security service will inspect the traffic. For this lab, enable
   (check) this option and enter a port value value (ex. 8080).

-  **iRules** – SSLO now allows for the insertion of additional iRule
   logic at different points. An iRule defined at the service only
   affects traffic flowing across this service. It is important to
   understand, however, that these iRules must not be used to control
   traffic flow (ex. pools, nodes, virtuals, etc.), but rather should be
   used to view/modify application layer protocol traffic. For example,
   an iRule assigned here could be used to view and modify HTTP traffic
   flowing to/from the service. Additional iRules are not required,
   however, so leave this empty.

-  Click Save.

-  **Inline layer 3 service** – select the Generic Inline Layer 3
   service from the catalog and click Add, or simply double-click the
   Generic Inline Layer 3 service.

   .. image:: /_static/image33.png
      :height: 300px

-  **Name** – provide a unique name to this service (example “IPS”).

-  **IP Family** – this setting defines the IP family used with this
   layer 3 service. Leave it set to IPv4.

-  **Auto Manage Addresses** – when enabled the Auto Manage Addresses
   setting provides a set of unique, non-overlapping, non-routable IP
   addresses to be used by the security service. If disabled, the To and
   From IP addresses must be configured manually. It is recommended to
   leave this option enabled (checked).

.. Note::
   In environments where SSLO is introduced to existing security devices,
   it is a natural tendency to not want to have to move these devices.
   And while SSLO certainly allows it, by not moving the security devices
   into SSLO protect enclaves, customers run the risk of exposing sensitive
   decrypted traffic, unintentionally, to other devices that may be connected
   to these existing networks.  It is therefore highly recommended, and a
   security best practice, to remove SSLO integrated security devices from
   existing networks and place them entirely within the isolated enclave
   created and maintained by SSLO.

.. image:: /_static/image34.png
   :height: 300px

-  **To Service Configuration** – the “To Service” defines the network
   connectivity from SSLO to the inline security device.

   -  **To Service** – with the Auto Manage Addresses option enabled,
      this IP address will be pre-defined, therefore the inbound side of
      the service must match this IP subnet. With the Auto Manage
      Addresses option disabled, the IP address must be defined
      manually. For this lab, leave the 198.19.64.7/25 address intact.

   -  **VLAN** – select the Create New option, provide a unique name
      (ex. IPS\_in), select the F5 interface connecting to the inbound
      side of the service, and add a VLAN tag value if required. For
      this lab, select interface 1.3 and VLAN tag 50.

-  **Service Down Action** – SSLO also natively monitors the load
   balanced pool of security devices, and if all pool members fail, can
   actively bypass this service (**Ignore**), or stop all traffic
   (**Reset**, **Drop**). For this lab, leave it set to Ignore.

   .. image:: /_static/image35.png
      :height: 300px

-  **L3 Devices** – this defines the inbound-side IP address of the
   inline layer 3 service, used for routing traffic to this device.
   Multiple load balanced IP addresses can be defined here. Click Add,
   enter 198.19.64.64, then click Done.

-  **From Service Configuration** – the “From Service” defines the
   network connectivity from the inline security device to SSLO.

   -  **From Service** – with the Auto Manage Addresses option enabled,
      this IP address will be pre-defined, therefore the outbound side
      of the service must match this IP subnet. With the Auto Manage
      Addresses option disabled, the IP address must be defined
      manually. For this lab, leave the 198.19.65.245/25 address intact.

   -  **VLAN** – select the Create New option, provide a unique name
      (ex. IPS\_out), select the F5 interface connecting to the outbound
      side of the service, and add a VLAN tag value if required. For
      this lab, select interface 1.3 and VLAN tag 60.

-  **Enable Port Remap** – this setting allows SSLO to remap the port of
   HTTPS traffic flowing across this service. This is advantageous when
   a security service defines port 443 traffic as encrypted HTTPS and
   natively ignores it. By remapping HTTPS traffic to, say, port 8181,
   the security service will inspect the traffic. For this lab, enable
   (check) this option and enter a port value value (ex. 8181).

-  **Manage SNAT Settings** – SSLO now defines an option to enable SNAT
   (source NAT) across an inline layer 3/HTTP service. The primary use
   case for this is horizontal SSLO scaling, where independent SSLO
   devices are scaled behind a separate load balancer but share the same
   inline layer 3/HTTP services. As these devices must route back to
   SSLO, there are now multiple SSLO devices to route back to. SNAT
   allows the layer 3/HTTP device to know which SSLO sent the packets
   for proper routing. SSLO scaling also requires that the Auto Manage
   option be disabled, to provide separate address spaces on each SSLO.
   For this, leave it set to None.

-  **iRules** – SSLO now allows for the insertion of additional iRule
   logic at different points. An iRule defined at the service only
   affects traffic flowing across this service. It is important to
   understand, however, that these iRules must not be used to control
   traffic flow (ex. pools, nodes, virtuals, etc.), but rather should be
   used to view/modify application layer protocol traffic. For example,
   an iRule assigned here could be used to view and modify HTTP traffic
   flowing to/from the service. Additional iRules are not required,
   however, so leave this empty.

-  **Inline HTTP service** – an inline HTTP service is defined as an
   explicit or transparent proxy for HTTP (web) traffic. Select the WSA
   HTTP Proxy service from the catalog and click Add, or simply double-
   click the WSA HTTP Proxy service, or any other HTTP Proxy service in
   the catalog.

   .. image:: /_static/image37.png

-  **Name** – provide a unique name to this service (example “Proxy”).

-  **IP Family** – this setting defines the IP family used with this
   layer 3 service. Leave it set to IPv4.

-  **Auto Manage Addresses** – when enabled the Auto Manage Addresses
   setting provides a set of unique, non-overlapping, non-routable IP
   addresses to be used by the security service. If disabled, the To and
   From IP addresses must be configured manually. It is recommended to
   leave this option enabled (checked).

-  **Proxy Type** – this defines the proxy mode that the inline HTTP
   service is in. For this lab, set this option to Explicit.

-  **To Service Configuration** – the “To Service” defines the network
   connectivity from SSLO to the inline security device.

   -  **To Service** – with the Auto Manage Addresses option enabled,
      this IP address will be pre-defined, therefore the inbound side of
      the service must match this IP subnet. With the Auto Manage
      Addresses option disabled, the IP address must be defined
      manually. For this lab, leave the 198.19.96.7/25 address intact.

   -  **VLAN** – select the Create New option, provide a unique name
      (ex. Proxy\_in), select the F5 interface connecting to the inbound
      side of the service, and add a VLAN tag value if required. For
      this lab, select interface 1.3 and VLAN tag 110.

-  **Service Down Action** – SSLO also natively monitors the load
   balanced pool of security devices, and if all pool members fail, can
   actively bypass this service (**Ignore**), or stop all traffic
   (**Reset**, **Drop**). For this lab, leave it set to Ignore.

   .. image:: /_static/image38.png
      :height: 300px

-  **HTTP Proxy Devices** – this defines the inbound-side IP address of
   the inline HTTP service, used for passing traffic to this device.
   Multiple load balanced IP addresses can be defined here. For a
   transparent proxy HTTP service, only an IP address is required. For
   an explicit proxy HTTP service, the IP address and listening port is
   required. Click Add, enter 198.19.96.66 for the IP Address, and 3128
   for the Port, then click Done.

-  **From Service Configuration** – the “From Service” defines the
   network connectivity from the inline security device to SSLO.

   -  **From Service** – with the Auto Manage Addresses option enabled,
      this IP address will be pre-defined, therefore the outbound side
      of the service must match this IP subnet. With the Auto Manage
      Addresses option disabled, the IP address must be defined
      manually. For this lab, leave the 198.19.96.245/25 address intact.

   -  **VLAN** – select the Create New option, provide a unique name
      (ex. Proxy\_out), select the F5 interface connecting to the
      outbound side of the service, and add a VLAN tag value if
      required. For this lab, select interface 1.3 and VLAN tag 120.

-  **Manage SNAT Settings** – SSLO now defines an option to enable SNAT
   (source NAT) across an inline layer 3/HTTP service. The primary use
   case for this is horizontal SSLO scaling, where independent SSLO
   devices are scaled behind a separate load balancer but share the same
   inline layer 3/HTTP services. As these devices must route back to
   SSLO, there are now multiple SSLO devices to route back to. SNAT
   allows the layer 3/HTTP device to know which SSLO sent the packets
   for proper routing. SSLO scaling also requires that the Auto Manage
   option be disabled, to provide separate address spaces on each SSLO.
   For this, leave it set to None.

-  **Authentication Offload** – when an Access authentication profile is
   attached to an explicit forward proxy topology, this option will
   present the authenticated username value to the service as an
   X-Authenticated-User HTTP header. For this lab, leave it disabled
   (unchecked).

-  **iRules** – SSLO now allows for the insertion of additional iRule
   logic at different points. An iRule defined at the service only
   affects traffic flowing across this service. It is important to
   understand, however, that these iRules must not be used to control
   traffic flow (ex. pools, nodes, virtuals, etc.), but rather should be
   used to view/modify application layer protocol traffic. For example,
   an iRule assigned here could be used to view and modify HTTP traffic
   flowing to/from the service. Additional iRules are not required,
   however, so leave this empty.

-  **ICAP service** – an ICAP service is an RFC 3507-defined service
   that provides some set of services over the ICAP protocol. Select the
   Digital Guardian ICAP service from the catalog and click Add, or
   simply double-click the Digital Guardian ICAP service, or any other
   ICAP service in the catalog.

   .. image:: /_static/image40.png
      :height: 300px

-  **Name** – provide a unique name to this service (example “DLP”).

-  **IP Family** – this setting defines the IP family used with this
   layer 3 service. Leave it set to IPv4.

-  **ICAP Devices** – this defines the IP address of the ICAP service,
   used for passing traffic to this device. Multiple load balanced IP
   addresses can be defined here. Click Add, enter **10.70.0.10** for
   the IP Address, and **1344** for the Port, and then click Done.

-  **ICAP Headers** – select either **Default** or **Custom** to specify
   additional ICAP headers. To add custom headers, select Custom,
   otherwise leave as Default.

   .. image:: /_static/image41.png
      :height: 300px

-  **OneConnect** – the F5 OneConnect profile improves performance by
   reusing TCP connections to ICAP servers to process multiple
   transactions. If the ICAP servers do not support multiple ICAP
   transactions per TCP connection, do not enable this option. For this
   lab, leave the OneConnect setting enabled.

-  **Request URI Path** – this is the RFC 3507-defined URI request path
   to the ICAP service. Each ICAP security vendor will differ with
   respect to request and response URIs, and preview length, so it is
   important to review the vendor’s documentation. In this lab, enter **\/squidclamav**.

-  **Response URI Path** – this is the RFC 3507-defined URI response
   path to the ICAP service. Each ICAP security vendor will differ with
   respect to request and response URIs, and preview length, so it is
   important to review the vendor’s documentation. In this lab, enter **\/squidclamav**.

-  **Preview Max Length(bytes)** – this defines the maximum length of
   the ICAP preview. Each ICAP security vendor will differ with respect
   to request and response URIs, and preview length, so it is important
   to review the vendor’s documentation. A zero-length preview length
   implies that data will be streamed to the ICAP service, similar to an
   HTTP 100/Expect process, while any positive integer preview length
   defines the amount of data (in bytes) that are transmitted first,
   before streaming the remaining content. The ICAP service in this lab
   environment does not support a complete stream, so requires a modest
   amount of initial preview. In this lab, enter 524288.

-  **Service Down Action** – SSLO also natively monitors the load
   balanced pool of security devices, and if all pool members fail, can
   actively bypass this service (**Ignore**), or stop all traffic
   (**Reset**, **Drop**). For this lab, leave it set to Ignore.

-  **HTTP Version** – this defines whether SSLO sends HTTP/1.1 and
   HTTP/1.0 requests to the ICAP service.

-  **ICAP Policy** – an ICAP policy is a pre-defined LTM CPM policy that
   can be configured to control access to the ICAP service based on
   attributes of the HTTP request or response. ICAP processing is
   enabled by default, so an ICAP CPM policy can be used to disable the
   request and/or response ADAPT profiles.

-  **TAP service** – a TAP service is a passive device that simply
   receives a copy of traffic. Select the Cisco Sourcefire TAP service
   from the catalog and click Add, or simply Double-click the Cisco
   Sourcefire TAP service, or any other TAP service in the catalog.

   .. image:: /_static/image43.png

-  **Name** - provide a unique name to this service (example “TAP”).

-  **Mac Address** – for a tap service that is not directly connected to
   the F5, enter the device’s MAC address. For a tap service that is
   directly connected to the F5, the MAC address does not matter and can
   be arbitrarily defined. For this lab, enter 12:12:12:12:12:12.

-  **VLAN** – this defines the interface connecting the F5 to the TAP
   service. Click Create New and provide a unique name (ex. TAP\_in).

-  **Interface** – select the 1.4 interface.

-  **Enable Port Remap** – this setting allows SSLO to remap the port of
   HTTPS traffic flowing to this service. For this lab, leave the option
   disabled (unchecked).

-  **Service Chain List** – service chains are arbitrarily-ordered lists
   of security devices. Based on environmental requirements, different
   service chains may contain different re-used sets of services, and
   different types of traffic can be assigned to different service
   chains. For example, HTTP traffic may need to go through all of the
   security services, while non-HTTP traffic goes through a subset, and
   traffic destined to a financial service URL can bypass decryption and
   still flow through a smaller set of security services.

-  **Security Policy** – security policies are the set of rules that
   govern how traffic is processed in SSLO. The “actions” a rule can
   take include,

   -  Whether or not to allow the traffic

   -  Whether or not to decrypt the traffic

   -  Which service chain (if any) to pass the traffic through

   The SSLO Guided Configuration presents an intuitive rule-based,
   drag-and-drop user interface for the definition of security policies.

   .. image:: /_static/image52.png
      :height: 100px

   In the background, SSLO maintains these security policies as visual
   per-request policies. If traffic processing is required that exceeds
   the capabilities of the rule-based user interface, the underlying
   per-request policy can be managed directly.

   .. Note::
      Once the per-request policy is manipulated, the rules-based interface
      can no longer be used.

   For the lab, create an additional rule to bypass SSL for “Financial
   Data and Services” and “Health and Medicine” URL categories.

   -  Click Add to create a new rule.

      -  **Name** – provide a unique name for the rule (ex. “urlf\_bypass”).

      -  Conditions

         -  Select **HTTP Connect Catagory**

         -  **Category Lookup (All)** – add Financial Data and Services and
            Health and Medicine.

         .. Note::
            The Category Lookup (ALL) condition provides categorization for
            TLS SNI, HTTP Connect and HTTP Host information.

      -  **Action** – select Allow.

      -  **Service Chain** – select the ssloSC\_my\_sub\_service\_chain
         L2/TAP service chain.

      Notice in the list of rules that the **All Traffic** rule intercepts
      but does not send traffic to a service chain. For the lab, edit this
      rule to send all intercepted traffic to a service chain.

      -  Click the pencil icon to edit this rule.

      -  Service Chain – select the service chain containing all of the services.

-  **Interception Rule** – interception rules are based on the selected
   topology and define the “listeners”, analogous to LTM virtual
   servers, that accept and process different types of traffic (ex. TCP,
   UDP, other). The resulting LTM virtual servers will bind the SSL
   settings, VLANs, IPs, and security policies created in the topology
   workflow.

   -  **Ingress Network (VLANs)** – this defines the VLANs through which
      traffic will enter. For a transparent forward proxy topology, this
      would be a client-side VLAN. Select client-net.

   -  **L7 Interception Rules** – FTP and email protocol traffic are all
      “server-speaks-first” protocols, and therefore SSLO must process
      these separately from typical client-speaks-first protocols like
      HTTP. This selection enables processing of each of these
      protocols, which create separate port-based listeners for each. As
      required, selectively enable the additional protocols that need to
      be decrypted and inspected through SSLO. Select FTP, IMAP, POP3
      and SMTP

   -  Click Save & Next.

   **Egress Setting** – traffic egress settings are now defined
   per-topology and manage both the gateway route and outbound SNAT settings.

-  **Manage SNAT Settings** – enables per-topology instance SNAT
   settings. For this lab, select Auto Map.

-  **Gateways** – enables per-topology instance gateway routing. Options
   are to use the system default route, to use an existing gateway pool,
   or to create a new gateway. For this lab, select Create New.

-  **IPv4 Outbound Gateways** – when creating a new gateway, this
   section provides the ratio and gateway address settings.

-  **Ratio** – multiple gateway IP addresses are load balanced in an LTM
   pool, and the ratio setting allows SSLO to proportion traffic to the
   gateway members, as required. A ratio on 1 for all members evenly
   distributes the load across them. For this lab, select 1.

-  **Address** – this is the next hop gateway IP address. For this lab,
   enter 10.30.0.1.

-  Click Save & Next.

-  **Summary** – the summary page presents an expandable list of all of
   the workflow-configured objects. To expand the details for any given
   setting, click the corresponding arrow icon on the far right. To edit
   any given setting, click the corresponding pencil icon. Clicking the
   pencil icon will send the workflow back to the selected settings
   page.

   -  When satisfied with the defined settings, click Deploy.

   Upon successfully deploying the configuration, SSL Orchestrator will
   now display a **Dashboard** view

   .. image:: /_static/image57.jpeg
      :height: 400px

   The **Interception Rules** tab shows the listeners that were created
   per the selected topology.

   .. image:: /_static/image58.png
      :height: 400px

   In the above,

-  The **-in-t-4** listener defines normal TCP IPv4 traffic.

-  The **-in-u-4** listener defines normal UDP IPv4 traffic.

-  The **-ot-4** listener defines normal non-TCP/non-UDP IPv4 traffic.

-  The **-ftp**, **-ftps**, **-pop3**, **-smtp25** and **-smtp587**
       listeners create paths for each respective protocol.

Step 4: Test the solution
-------------------------

To test the deployed solution, use the following options:

-  Server certificate test

   Open a browser on the client system and navigate to any
   remote HTTPS site, for example,
   `*https://www.google.com* <http://www.google.com/>`__
   Once the site opens in the browser, check the server certificate of
   the site and verify that it has been issued by the local CA
   configured in SSLO. This confirms that the SSL forward proxy
   functionality enabled by SSL Orchestrator is working correctly.

   .. image:: /_static/image60.jpeg
      :height: 200px

-  Decrypted traffic analysis on the F5

   Perform a tcpdump on the F5 system to observe the decrypted clear
   text traffic. This confirms SSL interception by SSLO.

   **tcpdump -lnni [interface or VLAN name] -Xs0**

   As a function of adding a new service, the UI requires a name for
   each (source and destination) network. SSL Orchestrator will then
   create separate source and destination VLANs for inline security
   devices, and those VLANs will be encapsulated within separate
   application service paths. For example, given an inline layer 2
   service named “FireEye” with its “From BIGIP VLAN”
   named “\ **FireEye\_in**\ ”, and its “To BIGIP VLAN” named
   “\ **FireEye\_out**\ ”, its corresponding BIG-IP VLANs would be
   accessible via the following syntax:

   ***ssloN\_** + [network name] + **.app/ssloN\_** + [network name]*

   Example: *ssloN\_FireEye\_in.app/ssloN\_FireEye\_in
   ssloN\_FireEye\_in.app/ssloN\_FireEye\_in*

   A tcpdump on the source side VLAN of this FireEye service would
   therefore look like this:

   **tcpdump -lnni ssloN_FireEye_in.app/ssloN_FireEye_in -Xs0**

   The security service VLANs and their corresponding application
   services are all visible from the BIG-IP UI under Network -> VLANs.

-  Decrypted traffic analysis on the security services

   Depending on the type of security service, it may easier to log into
   the console shell and run a similar tcpdump capture on the inbound
   or outbound interface, to tail its capture logs, or to log into its
   management UI and capture analytics. A tcpdump capture usually
   requires root or sudo access.

   **tcpdump -lnni [inerface] -Xs0**
