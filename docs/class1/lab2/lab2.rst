LAB 2 – CREATE A GATEWAY REVERSE PROXY SSLO
===========================================

SSL Orchestrator generally defines inbound traffic flows with a
“gateway” architecture. That is, SSLO is designed to sit in front of
a separate ADC/load balancer or routed path, and not directly in
front of applications, though it is technically possible to support
a “single instance” listener going to a single pool of resources.
This lab will be re- using the security services created in the
first lab to create a single inbound “gateway” service SSLO
configuration.

.. Note::
   This lab will consist of an abbreviated set of steps, as some of the
   objects created in Lab1 (services and service chains) will be fully
   re-usable here.  If any of these objects have not been created, please
   review Lab 1 for more detailed configuration instructions.


Step 1: Review the lab diagram and map out the services and endpoints
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Specifically, note that in this lab there is a web server on the
internal network (the client’s network in this case) that external
users want to get to. An external client desktop exists on the
external/outbound network, that accesses these resources through
SSLO.

-  The external client is attached to a *10.30.0.0/24* network and is
   assigned the IP *10.30.0.70*. This network is attached to the BIG-IP
   1.2 interface.

-  The web server is an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS server configured with Apache2
   and PHP5, and listens on five addresses:

   -  10.20.0.90
   -  10.20.0.91
   -  10.20.0.92

   Each instance includes a simple Apache2 text page that also shows
   which site was accessed. The pages are all (only) hosted via HTTPS
   port 443.

-  In lieu of a separate DNS server in the lab, the external client has
   static /etc/hosts entries that map the above addresses to the
   following URLs, respectively:

   - test0.f5demolabs.com
   - test1.f5demolabs.com
   - test3.f5demolabs.com

-  A wildcard (\*.f5demolabs.com) server certificate and private key
   have been installed on the SSL Orchestrator.

   The external client has two options for accessing the internal
   websites: via wildcard (0.0.0.0/0) gateway, and direct IP listener.
   The lab will explore both options below.

.. Note::
   SSL Orchestrator sends all traffic through an inline layer 3 or HTTP
   device in the same direction - entering through the inbound interface.
   It is likely, therefor, that the layer 3 device may not be able to
   correctly route both outbound (forward proxy) and inbound (reverse proxy)
   traffic at the same time.  Please see the appendix, “Routing considerations
   for layer 3 devices” for more details.


Step 2: Configure an L3 inbound SSLO deployment through Guided Configuration
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this scenario, an SSLO L3 inbound listener is configured as a
gateway service. It will listen on a wildcard VIP (0.0.0.0/0), or
otherwise specific subnet (vs. a dedicated single IP), and terminate
inbound TLS traffic flows via wildcard or subject alternative name
(SAN) certificate.

-  Select the SSL Orchestrator then select Configuration.

-  In the SSL Orchestrator dashboard view, select the Topologies tab
   (bottom) and click Add.

-  **Configuration review and prerequisites** – take a moment to review
   the topology options and workflow configuration, then click Next.

-  Topology Properties

   -  **Name**: sslo\_inbound\_1

   -  **Protocol**: TCP

   -  **IP Family**: IPv4

   -  **Topology**: select L3 Inbound

   -  Click Save & Next

   .. image:: /_static/image64.png
      :height: 400px

-  **SSL Configuration** – an inbound topology requires different SSL
   settings.

   -  Click Show Advanced Setting

   .. image:: /_static/image65.png
      :height: 200px

-  lient-side SSL

   -  **Cipher Type**: Cipher String

   -  **Cipher String**: DEFAULT

   -  **Certificate Key Chain** – the certificate key chain represents
      the certificate and private key of an endpoint server instance
      (the target of a remote client’s request). In a gateway-mode
      configuration, this would typically be a wildcard of Subject
      Alternative Name (SAN) certificate in the event the SSLO inbound
      listener was intended to service multiple sites. In this lab a
      wildcard certificate has been provided. Select the pencil icon to
      edit, then select the wildcard.f5demolabs.com certificate and
      private key and click Done.

      .. Note::
         SSL Settings minimally require RSA-based template and CA certificates
         but can also support Elliptic Curve (ECDSA) certificates.

-  Server-side SSL

   -  **Cipher Type**: Cipher String

   -  **Cipher String**: DEFAULT

   -  **Trusted Certificate Authority** – as an inbound solution, the
      server-side SSL would be pointing to internal servers. While
      definitely possible to perform validation against internal server
      certificates, it is likely less important to do so. Leave this
      setting as is.

-  **Expire Certificate Response** – Assuming no internal certificate
   validation is needed, the default **drop** setting will cause the
   connection to fail, so set this to Ignore.

-  **Untrusted Certificate Authority** – Assuming no internal
   certificate validation is needed, the default **drop** setting will
   cause the connection to fail, so set this to Ignore.

-  **[Advanced] OCSP** – Assuming no internal certificate validation is
   needed, any OCSP configuration will cause the connection to fail, so
   leave this as is.

-  **[Advanced] CRL** – Assuming no internal certificate validation is
   needed, any CRL configuration will cause the connection to fail, so
   leave this as is.

-  Click Save & Next.

-  **Services List** – the same services can be leveraged here, so
   simply click Save & Next.

-  **Service Chain List** – the same service chains can be leveraged
   here, so simply click Save & Next.

-  **Security Policy** – the security policy requirements are specific
   to each organization, though an inbound security policy would likely
   be less complex than an outbound policy.

-  Delete the built-in “Pinners\_Rule”, edit the “All Traffic” policy to
   add the service chain with the L2 and TAP services (only),

-  Click Save & Next.

-  **Interception Rule** – here is where a gateway-mode topology and the
   existing application topology generally differ. Where an explicit
   application topology “bolts onto” an existing application that
   performs its own SSL management (SSL offload), traffic management
   (pools) and traffic intelligence (iRules, profiles), the gateway-mode
   SSLO topology provides a single, generic entry point for potentially
   multiple applications, and would sit *in front of* another ADC or
   routing device. This is mostly useful when an SSL visibility device
   must sit closer to the outer edge of an environment, and/or when the
   SSL visibility product “owner” does not otherwise own the
   applications or ADC(s).

   It is possible to configure an L3 Inbound topology configuration
   with a single target IP address and port and destination pool
   (targeted mode). However, an L3 Inbound topology must re-encrypt the
   inbound traffic. For this lab choose Gateway Mode

-  **Gateway mode** – interception rule listening on a wildcard IP, port
   443, with a wildcard or SAN certificate. Clients route through SSLO.

   -  Click Hide Advanced Setting

   -  **Source Address**: 0.0.0.0/0

   -  **Destination Address/Mask**: 0.0.0.0/0

   -  **Port**: 443

   -  **VLANs**: outbound (this is the server-side VLAN)

   -  **[Protocol Settings] L7 Profile Type** – this setting enables or
      disables HTTP processing. Select HTTP

   -  **[Protocol Settings] L7 Profile** – if the above option is set to
      HTTP, this option selects a specific HTTP profile. Set to HTTP and
      /Common/http.

-  **Summary** – the summary page presents an expandable list of all of
   the workflow-configured objects. To expand the details for any given
   setting, click the corresponding arrow icon on the far right. To edit
   any given setting, click the corresponding pencil icon. Clicking the
   pencil icon will send the workflow back to the selected settings
   page.

   - When satisfied with the defined settings, click Deploy.

-  **Testing** – for gateway-mode testing, the lab’s inbound desktop
   client includes static Hosts entries that match the *real* IPs of the
   internal web server,

   - test0.f5demolabs.com = 10.20.0.90
   - test1.f5demolabs.com = 10.20.0.91
   - test3.f5demolabs.com = 10.20.0.92

   and a static persistent route that points 10.1.10.0/24 traffic to
   the BIG-IP outbound (external) VLAN self- IP (10.1.20.100).
   `*www.f5demolabs.com * <http://www.f5demolabs.com/>`__\ = 10.30.0.200
